/**
 * The order the articles are PRINTED in on the sale ticket (LC-08-01-07), as the
 * back office administers it.
 * <p>
 * Three readings of the same basket, and the store picks one: the order the cashier
 * scanned them in — what the customer watched happen, and the register's historical
 * behaviour —, alphabetically by label, or grouped under their article family. Only
 * the grouped mode prints headings; the two others are a plain sort.
 * <p>
 * A pure static rule, deliberately outside {@link TicketPrinterService}: it decides
 * nothing about paper and talks to no collaborator, so it can be exercised on its own
 * exactly like {@link PrintPolicy}.
 * <p>
 * The order applies to the PRINTED ticket alone. The stored lines keep their entry
 * order and their line numbers whatever is administered — the ticket is a rendering,
 * the sale is the record — and the VAT ventilation, computed over the same lines,
 * cannot move because a sort cannot change a sum.
 * <p>
 * Non-instantiable.
