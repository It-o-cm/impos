/**
 * Outbox of the store synchronization (phase 5): one row per entity awaiting
 * push to the store node, written in the same transaction as the business
 * event (ticket closing, session lifecycle, refund creation, cash movement)
 * so nothing is ever lost. The background push loop drains it in type order
 * (sessions first, then movements, then tickets, then refunds, events last)
 * and deletes each row once the store node acknowledged it; failures stay in
 * place with their error and are retried on the next cycle.
 * <p>
 * {@code attempts} and {@code lastError} make a stuck item observable with
 * one query on the register (poison items keep accumulating attempts and
 * never block the rest of the batch); an empty table means "fully
 * synchronized". Enqueueing is a no-op without a configured store URL, so
 * a standalone register and the store node itself never accumulate rows.
