/**
 * How many times one FUNCTION was used on one node on one day
 * (BO-08-02-02).
 *
 * <p>A COUNTER, not a journal: the statistics ask how often a function is
 * used, by point of sale and enseigne, not who pressed it at 10:42. One row
 * per day, node, channel and function, incremented in place — a register
 * that sells all day writes a few dozen rows, not thousands.
 *
 * <p>The register counts its own functions, the store node its back-office
 * functions; both travel up with the node reports, and the receiving node
 * REPLACES the count it holds for the same key, so a report sent twice counts
 * once.
