/**
 * A cash movement of one register: a first-class WITNESS of a drawer
 * operation the cashier performed during a session — a withdrawal, a deposit,
 * an expense, a customer down-payment, or a cash-count declaration. The cash
 * session keeps five AMOUNTS (float, counted, theoretical, variance,
 * withdrawn) but no MOVEMENTS; this entity records the suite of gestures that
 * produced them, which is what the electronic journal needs to search on
 * (BO-04-01-12/33/35/36/37/40/44). It is the ground floor of the conditional
 * safe lot (D) as well.
 * <p>
 * Semantic contract, mirroring {@link CashSession} and the ticket graph:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Written in the register's own database, so it survives restarts by
 *       construction, and pushed to the store node THROUGH THE OUTBOX (entity
 *       type {@code MOVEMENT}, drained right after its session so the session
 *       it references is already consolidated), never by a synchronous call in
 *       the sale thread — a register cut off from the network keeps recording
 *       movements. Upsert by {@link #movementUid}, so re-pushing is idempotent.</li>
 *   <li>Every field describes the MOVEMENT itself — the sale-floor fact to
 *       consolidate — and is therefore CARRIED by the store push, on the same
 *       side of the frontier as a ticket or a session. None of them is local
 *       register auth state (unlike {@code failedAttempts}/{@code lockedUntil}):
 *       {@link #endorsedBy} names the manager who approved a large movement, a
 *       fact of the operation, never a secret.</li>
 * </ul>
