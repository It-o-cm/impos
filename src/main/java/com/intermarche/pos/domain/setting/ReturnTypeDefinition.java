/**
 * A RETURN TYPE administered in the back office and distributed to the
 * registers ({@code BO-03-13-01} to {@code -04}, {@code -11}, {@code -12}).
 *
 * <p>Until here a return type was an entry of a list of the
 * {@code RETURN_TYPE} kind, or of the semicolon-separated {@code return.types}
 * setting before it: a label and option markers typed as text. That is enough
 * to draw a key and not enough to administer a type — nothing could say which
 * of its options were set without parsing a string, and a type could not be
 * kept switched off without being retyped later.
 *
 * <p>So the type becomes a referential of its own, with its own screen and its
 * own distribution domain: a CODE the refunds and the return lines are filed
 * under, a LABEL the cashier reads, one column per option the register honours
 * and an ACTIVE flag. The register offers the active types; the list and the
 * setting remain its fallback while the shop administers no type here, so a
 * shop that never opens the new screen keeps exactly the keys it had.
