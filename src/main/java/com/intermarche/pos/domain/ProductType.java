 * Enumeration representing how a product is quantified and sold.
 * Distinguishing between weighted items and unit items is critical
 * for supermarket Point of Sale (POS) systems.
 * <p>
 * Sale-flow consequences: UNIT lines display "x n", can merge (when
 * unmodified, same price) and accept the line-quantity edition; WEIGHT
 * lines price per kilogram, display "n,nnn kg", never merge (one weighing =
 * one line) and refuse the quantity edition — their quantity IS the weight,
 * set by the scale, the fruits screen or an embedded-weight 2x label.
