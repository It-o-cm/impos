/**
 * A commercial document issued on a closed ticket: an invoice, or a delivery note.
 * <p>
 * DERIVED, NEVER RECOMPUTED. The sale happened once, on the ticket, and the ticket
 * is immutable from the moment it closes: the document does not re-price anything,
 * it states what was sold and to whom. What it does keep of its own are the things
 * that could change afterwards and must not — the totals as they were printed, and
 * the customer AS THEY WERE at the moment of issue. A customer's address gets
 * corrected, a business is renamed; a document already handed over does not follow.
 * That is why the addressee is stored twice here: a link to the live customer, for
 * the reports and the searches, and a flat copy of what was printed on the paper.
 * <p>
 * The ticket lines are NOT copied. They belong to a closed ticket, they cannot
 * change, and duplicating them would create a second truth to keep in step with the
 * first. The per-rate VAT table is likewise recomputed from those lines at render
 * time, by the same rule the receipt uses — {@code BO-03-03-04} requires the two to
 * agree, and recomputing from the same source is the only way they cannot drift.
 * <p>
 * {@link #printCount} carries the duplicate rule of {@code LC-08-04-17}: the first
 * print is the original, every later one is marked as a duplicate, and a second
 * request for a ticket that already has a document produces that duplicate rather
 * than a second original.
