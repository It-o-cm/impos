/**
 * The INALTERABLE TRACE of a ticket put on hold (LC-04-01-03, article 88 of the
 * law against VAT fraud): every putting on hold, every resumption and every purge
 * of a ticket left on hold at the Z closing is recorded with the content the
 * ticket had at that moment, signed and chained to the previous record of the
 * same register.
 *
 * <p>The ticket on hold is a draft the register keeps changing; this record is
 * what it was, frozen. The signature is a SHA-256 over the record's identifying
 * fields, its content and the signature of the record before it ({@code GENESIS}
 * for the first one): changing, removing or inserting a record breaks the chain
 * from that record on, and {@link #computeSignature()} lets anyone holding the
 * rows check it. Records are never updated nor deleted; the register pushes each
 * one to the store node, which keeps its copy under the register's own id and
 * checks the same chain.
 *
 * <p>Shared by the register and the store node, identical on both.
