/**
 * A sale made in TRAINING mode (LC-13-05-06), kept in a table of its own.
 *
 * <p>A training sale is no real sale: it consumes no ticket number, enters no
 * fiscal chain and must never count in the revenue or the accounting flows. Yet
 * the back office consults it in the electronic journal. It therefore travels
 * up to the store node in this dedicated table, which no revenue report, no Z
 * and no accounting export reads, rather than as a ticket every one of them
 * would have to learn to exclude.
 *
 * <p>Shared by the register, which writes the row and pushes it, and the store
 * node, which keeps the pushed copy under the register's own id.
