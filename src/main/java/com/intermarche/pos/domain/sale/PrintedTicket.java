/**
 * A ticket a register PRINTED, kept in its 42-column format and carried up to
 * the store node, which puts it at the disposal of third-party services — the
 * customer's online account, the enseigne's mobile application (LC-08-02-02).
 *
 * <p>Every ticket the register generates is one: the customer's papers, the
 * store's technical tickets (session opening and closing, X and Z reports, cash
 * movements, unknown articles…) and the slips a policy kept from the printer.
 * The {@link Audience} tells them apart, and the {@link #source} names the
 * register function that produced the paper.
 *
 * <p>Shared by the register, which writes the row and pushes it, and the store
 * node, which keeps the pushed copy under the register's own id.
