/**
 * A PORTUGUESE FISCAL DOCUMENT issued by this register: a simplified invoice, an
 * invoice, a credit note or a receipt (LC-08-01-05, LC-08-04-18 to -23, LC-05-07-03).
 *
 * <p>The document is what the Portuguese tax administration reads: its number in its
 * series, its ATCUD, its place in the signature chain of the series and the QR payload
 * printed at its foot. The sale or the return it states stays where it is — the
 * {@link Ticket} or the {@link Refund} — and the document only points at it, with the
 * part of the sale it covers when one sale is stated on two documents (LC-08-01-06).
 *
 * <p>Issued by the register, and carried to the store node with the sale or the
 * return it states (BO-10-06-03): the node keeps the copy its SAF-T export is drawn
 * from, and never issues nor renumbers a document itself.
