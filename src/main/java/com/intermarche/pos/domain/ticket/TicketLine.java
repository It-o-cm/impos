/**
 * A persisted ticket line.
 * <p>
 * Phase 0 lot 2: each line carries the stable {@code lineUid} of its in-memory
 * counterpart (the future contractual lineId toward the valuation engine) and
 * snapshots of the EAN / PLU as they were entered, so a draft can be restored
 * faithfully after a register restart. The product reference becomes nullable:
 * unknown-item and deposit-return lines have no catalog product.
 * <p>
 * The {@code lineUid} is a single identity with three lives: in-memory cart
 * uid (TicketItem.uid), store-sync key (refund lines reference their original
 * line by uid, since database ids are register-local), and the contractual
 * lineId of the phase 7 valuation exchanges. The draft sync reconciles lines
 * by uid (update in place, orphan removal for the gone ones).
 * <p>
 * Merge policy at cart level (phase 3): only unmodified unit EAN lines at the
 * same price merge; weighed lines (one weighing = one line), price-embedded
 * scale stickers (no code carried), deposit returns and negative lines never
 * do. {@link #modifierLabel} and {@link #originalUnitPrice} persist an
 * endorsed price modification so it survives a restart without being asked
 * again (debt sweep).
