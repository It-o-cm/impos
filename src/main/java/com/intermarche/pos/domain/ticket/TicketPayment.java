/**
 * A payment registered on a ticket, specialized per method through
 * single-table inheritance (discriminator column payment_method).
 * <p>
 * {@link #paymentIndex} is the 1-based registration order: restart recovery
 * and the store-node ingestion rebuild the in-memory list in that order, so
 * the cashier sees the payments as they were taken. The {@link Factory}
 * instances are discovered by CDI and indexed by key in two places — the
 * draft persistence (saving in-memory entries) and the sync ingestion
 * (rebuilding pushed tickets); adding a payment method is therefore one new
 * subclass with its factory, nothing else. {@code getMethodKey()} resolves
 * the key from the discriminator annotation, unwrapping Hibernate proxies —
 * the same key strings flow through the session reports (totals per method)
 * and the sync payloads.
