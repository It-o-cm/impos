/**
 * A cash payment.

 * <ul>
 *   <li>Two amounts coexist: {@link TicketPayment#amount} is what the ticket
 *       receives (capped at the remaining due), {@link #tenderedAmount} is
 *       what the customer physically handed over. The change is their
 *       difference, computed by {@code PaymentService} and remembered as
 *       {@code lastChangeAmount} for the completion modal and the customer
 *       display.</li>
 *   <li>Registration opens the drawer — except in training mode, where the
 *       drawer stays shut (phase 6).</li>
 *   <li>Cash refunds are NOT negative cash payments: they are
 *       {@link Refund} documents whose cash method lowers the session's
 *       theoretical drawer amount.</li>
