/**
 * A customer refund against a closed ticket.
 * <p>
 * Phase 3 lot 4: the refund method is persisted, the VAT of the refunded
 * lines is restituted (tax-excluded and VAT totals), the refund is attached
 * to the cash session that performed it (cash refunds lower the theoretical
 * drawer amount), and the document is closed at creation.
 * <p>
 * Creation path: the four method buttons of the return screen request a
 * manager endorsement ("REFUND_&lt;METHOD&gt;_&lt;ticketId&gt;"); the
 * endorsement dispatch performs the refund transactionally. Two guards are
 * re-checked inside that transaction: per original line, the refunded
 * quantities summed across every past refund never exceed the sold quantity;
 * per ticket, past refunds plus the new one never exceed the ticket total
 * (this second cap also covers keyed-in free amounts). A guard refusal rolls
 * the transaction back with the message on the refund screen.
 * <p>
 * Method side effects: CASH opens the drawer and lowers the session's
 * theoretical amount; VOUCHER prints a store voucher whose number matches the
 * STORE_VOUCHER pattern (50 + 8-digit serial + 4-digit cents) and is thus
 * scannable as a payment on a later ticket when the amount fits 99,99 €;
 * LOYALTY stays a journal note until the phase 7 engine makes the balance
 * real; CARD logs the terminal gesture. {@link #refundNumber} (counter row
 * lock) is the store-sync upsert key. Blocked entirely in training mode.
