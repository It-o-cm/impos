/**
 * A technical event journal entry (NF525 direction): ticket closures and
 * cancellations, duplicata printing, payment resets, draft recoveries.
 * <p>
 * One row per event, stamped with the register that produced it. Extends
 * {@link PanacheEntity} directly (pure append-only journal, no audit fields).
 * <p>
 * Every log entry is enqueued for store synchronization (EVENT is the last
 * drained kind, after sessions, tickets and refunds) and upserted on the
 * store node by {@link #eventUid} — a UUID minted at creation precisely
 * because journal entries have no natural business number; re-pushing is
 * therefore idempotent. On the store node itself the enqueue is a no-op (no
 * store URL configured), so ingestion cannot loop.
