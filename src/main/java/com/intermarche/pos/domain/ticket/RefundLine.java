/**
 * A refunded line, snapshot of the original ticket line at refund time.
 * <p>
 * Phase 3 lot 4: the VAT rate of the original line is carried so the refund
 * restitutes the VAT it cancels, and {@link #originalLineId} is the anchor of
 * the double-refund guard (the refunded quantities of one original line are
 * summed across refunds and capped at the sold quantity).
 * <p>
 * {@link #originalLineId} is a register-local database id: it never travels.
 * The store synchronization references the original line by its stable
 * {@code lineUid} and the ingestion resolves it back to the store-local id —
 * the reason ticket lines must arrive before the refunds that cite them
 * (drain order). {@link #vatRate} feeds the per-rate ventilation printed on
 * the refund ticket.
