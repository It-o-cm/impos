/**
 * Per-terminal ticket sequence counter, stored in the register's database.
 * <p>
 * One row per register (terminal). The row is read with a pessimistic write
 * lock and incremented inside the ticket-creation transaction, guaranteeing a
 * strictly increasing, gap-aware sequence per terminal — the foundation of the
 * phase 1 fiscal chaining. Different terminals lock different rows, so there is
 * no contention (one register per database).
 * <p>
 * Extends {@link PanacheEntity} directly (no audit fields needed on a pure
 * technical counter).
 * <p>
 * The three sequences (tickets "C04-00000123", sessions "C04-S00012",
 * refunds "C04-R000012") and the chaining anchors all live on the same row,
 * so one pessimistic lock serializes every numbering and chaining mutation
 * of the register — the invariant the phase 1 fiscal chain rests on.
 * {@link #grandTotal} is perpetual: never reset, snapshotted on each closed
 * ticket ({@code Ticket.grandTotal}) so any truncation of the chain is visible.
