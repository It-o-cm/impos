/**
 * A user's decision to HIDE one {@link Feature} that their profile otherwise
 * allows (BO-01-04-08, "favoris").
 * <p>
 * The requirement is a personal convenience, not a right: within the limits
 * of what their profiles grant, an account may declutter its interface by
 * hiding features, menus or report types. A hidden feature is DISPLAY-only —
 * it never widens nor narrows what
 * {@link com.intermarche.pos.service.PermissionService} authorizes, it only
 * removes an entry the operator does not want to see. Hence its own table,
 * keyed by employee id and feature key, rather than a flag folded into the
 * authorization model: the two must not be confused.
 * <p>
 * The absence of a row is the normal state (nothing hidden); one row per
 * hidden feature is added when the operator hides it and removed when they
 * restore it.
