/**
 * A saved, reusable article selection (BO-02-03-31): a named grouping of
 * articles defined by search criteria, meant to restrict the perimeter of a
 * report or an export. The selection stores its criteria as the canonical
 * query string produced by {@code ArticleSearchCriteria}, so applying a
 * selection is exactly re-running that search — the same multi-criteria engine
 * the fiche list uses (BO-02-03-30), never a second, divergent one.
 * <p>
 * The stored form is a query string rather than a frozen list of article ids:
 * the selection is a live perimeter (an article integrated later that matches
 * the criteria joins the selection at the next view), which is what a reusable
 * grouping for reports and exports must be. Referential configuration, store
 * side of the frontier.
 * <p>
 * Fields are public to comply with Quarkus/Panache conventions.
