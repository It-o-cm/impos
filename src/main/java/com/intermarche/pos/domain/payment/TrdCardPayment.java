/**
 * A dematerialized meal-voucher (carte TRD) payment (EXP-60).
 * <p>
 * Semantic contract: like the paper meal voucher {@link TicketRestoPayment} it
 * is bound to the ticket's MEAL-VOUCHER ELIGIBLE base — a TRD card settles at
 * most what the eligible lines are worth — but unlike the paper title it also
 * carries a legal per-transaction CAP (plafond), administered at the point of
 * vente. Without its own discriminator it would record as a plain "CARD" with
 * neither base nor cap, which is precisely the gap this closes. Identity is the
 * discriminator value "TRD".
