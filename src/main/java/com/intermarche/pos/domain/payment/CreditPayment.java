/**
 * A customer-credit settlement ({@code LC-07-09-01}): the goods leave, the money
 * does not.
 *
 * <p>Unlike every other payment method, NOTHING IS COLLECTED at the till. What the
 * register does is name a debtor — a professional, an association, a town hall —
 * and the debt is settled monthly in the commercial management. So the account is
 * not a detail of the payment, it IS the payment: a credit line without an account
 * number states that someone owes money without saying who, which is worth nothing
 * to the accountant reading the ticket a month later.
 *
 * <p>The account NAME is carried alongside the number, deliberately duplicated from
 * the customer referential: {@code LC-07-09-06} prints it on the receipt, and the
 * receipt states the sale AS IT WAS — an account renamed or closed six months later
 * must not rewrite the paper the customer already holds.
