 * A SOCIAL PURCHASE CARD payment — the cartão de compras social (LC-08-01-06).

 * lines whose article carries the social-card eligibility; a social card settles
 * at most what those lines are worth. Where the register issues the Portuguese
 * fiscal documents, the eligible lines it paid are stated on a simplified
 * invoice of their own. Identity is the discriminator value "CAS", the code the
