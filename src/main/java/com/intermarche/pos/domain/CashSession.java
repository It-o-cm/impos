/**
 * A cash session of one register: opened with an initial float by a cashier,
 * closed by the Z report with the counted amount, the theoretical amount, the
 * variance and the withdrawal. Every ticket created while the session is open
 * is attached to it; sales are refused while no session is open.
 * <p>
 * The session lives in the register's own database, so it survives register
 * restarts by construction.
 * <p>
 * Semantic contract: at most one OPEN session per register (selling is
 * gated on it, except in training mode); the theoretical drawer amount is
 * opening float + cash payments of the session's closed tickets − its cash
 * refunds; the Z closing counts the drawer ({@code countDetail} keeps the
 * per-denomination JSON), persists the variance, and kills the register's
 * PARKED tickets. Pushed to the store node at opening AND closing (upsert
 * by {@code sessionNumber}), so consolidated tickets can reference their
 * session as soon as it exists.
