/**
 * Appends entries to the technical event journal, stamped with this register's
 * identifier. Joins the caller's transaction when one is active, so an event
 * and the state change it documents commit or roll back together.
 * <p>
 * The event uid (sync idempotency key) is minted HERE, at creation — the
 * journal has no natural business number, and the uid must exist before the
 * outbox row referencing the event is written in the same transaction. A
 * rolled-back business change therefore leaves neither the event nor its
 * outbox row: the journal never documents something that did not happen.
