/**
 * Restores the in-memory cart from the database at register startup.
 * <p>
 * Phase 0 lot 2: since the draft is persisted from the first article, a crash
 * or restart must not lose the sale. At startup this service looks for the
 * most recent OPEN draft of this terminal in its database,
 * rebuilds the cart (lines with their stable uids, totals, fidelity card) and
 * the already-registered payments, then reattaches the draft id. Older OPEN
 * drafts of the same terminal (crash leftovers) are cancelled.
 * <p>
 * The register comes back locked: the cashier logs in again and simply
 * continues the restored sale.
 * <p>
 * Cancelling the older OPEN drafts is not cleanup, it ENFORCES the
 * single-draft invariant the whole persistence relies on (one OPEN draft
 * per terminal). The payment restoration also covers the narrow crash
 * window between payment completion and ticket closing: when the restored
 * payments already settle the total, the completion flag is set back and
 * the cashier lands on the completion modal, not on a half-paid screen.
 * The restore machinery ({@code restoreDraft}) is deliberately shared with
 * the parked-ticket resume — one code path to trust for rebuilding a cart.
