 * The WIRE FORMAT of the node reports and of their answers (BO-08-01-17,
 * BO-08-03-*, BO-08-04-15/16/17/20, BO-08-02-02).
 *
 * <p>ONE CONVERSATION, TWO HOPS. A register reports to its store node, a
 * store node reports to the central node, and both carry the same payload:
 * the version the node runs and where its update stands, its peripherals,
 * its hardware and software inventory, the state of its integrations, the
 * functions it counted, the outcome of the maintenance orders it carried out.
 * A store adds its registers' last reports, so the central node sees the
 * whole line without ever reaching a register. The ANSWER travels back down
 * the same way: the version each node must run, and the maintenance orders
 * waiting for it.
 *
 * <p>Plain public fields and default constructors: the payload is mapped by
 * Jackson on both ends, and the lists start empty so an absent list reads as
 * nothing to report rather than as a null to guard.
