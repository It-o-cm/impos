/**
 * The UPDATE STATE MACHINE every node runs on itself — register, store node
 * and central node alike (BO-08-03-04/05/07/09/10, BO-08-04-01/02/14).
 *
 * <p>The upstream node says which version this node must run; this class
 * decides whether to go and, if so, goes: DOWNLOADING the package, VERIFYING
 * it against the announced SHA-256, INSTALLING it, and running its
 * SELF-TEST. A package that fails its self-test is ROLLED BACK to the version
 * it replaced (BO-08-04-14) — the application only, never the referential
 * data, which this class does not touch. A failure is RETRIED at the next
 * report, up to the administered number of attempts (BO-08-04-01); a manual
 * forcing from the deployment console (BO-08-04-02) resets the count and
 * runs even outside the lot's window.
 *
 * <p>WHEN TO GO. Inside the lot's time window (BO-08-03-04) the node updates
 * at its next report; outside it, only at START-UP (BO-08-03-07) — the
 * seasonal register switched on after the deployment catches up when it
 * boots, and never in the middle of a day it was not scheduled for. A busy
 * node (a register with a sale on the screen) defers to its next report.
 *
 * <p>NO BINARY IS SWAPPED in this suite: installing records the new version
 * on the node, which is what every report then carries upstream. The steps,
 * their order, their checks and their journal are real; the jar on the disk
 * is the one thing a deployment tool outside the application replaces.
