/**
 * Creates the initial administrator employee when the employee table is
 * empty — the production bootstrap of a ROOT node (the same pattern as
 * imvaluation's and imfid's {@code UserBootstrap}).
 * <p>
 * Authentication reads the {@code employees} table, and the dev/test seed
 * ({@code DataInitializer}) does not exist in a production build: a freshly
 * installed root node would otherwise leave nobody able to sign in — and the
 * import endpoints it must serve first are {@code @RolesAllowed("ADMIN")}.
 * <p>
 * Differences from the sibling bootstraps, both deliberate:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The password property is OPTIONAL rather than required: a REGISTER
 *       node receives its employees through the referential pull and must
 *       boot with the property unset. No variable = no account = nobody can
 *       sign in on a virgin node — never a guessable default.</li>
 *   <li>The register PIN of the bootstrap account is the hash of the same
 *       secret, because the column is mandatory; a non-numeric secret is
 *       untypable on the lane numpad, so the account effectively opens the
 *       back office only, until a real PIN is administered.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The bootstrap only ever runs when NO employee exists at all: once any
 * account has been created, this class never touches the table again, and in
 * particular never resets a password an administrator has changed.
