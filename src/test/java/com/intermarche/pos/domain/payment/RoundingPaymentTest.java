/**
 * Unit tests for {@link RoundingPayment} and its nested {@link RoundingPayment.Factory},
 * targeting 100% branch coverage.
 * <p>
 * The class is straight-line (no ternary, no null guard) and carries no field of its
 * own: the amount constructor, the JPA default constructor, the inherited
 * {@link TicketPayment#getChecksum()} and the factory members only need to be reached
 * once each. The tests assert the signed amount is forwarded in both directions, that
 * the default constructor leaves inherited fields at their declared defaults, that the
 * inherited checksum folds in the signed amount, that the "ARRONDI" discriminator
 * resolves through {@link TicketPayment#getMethodKey()}, that the factory key is
 * "ARRONDI", and that the factory builds a RoundingPayment carrying the amount while
 * ignoring the tendered argument. No static finder or persist is reached, so no
 * Panache mocking is required. Each test is fully isolated and asserts absolute
 * expected values.
