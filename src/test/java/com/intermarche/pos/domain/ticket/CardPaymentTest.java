/**
 * Unit tests for {@link CardPayment}, targeting 100% branch coverage.
 * <p>
 * The class carries no branching logic: both constructors and the CDI
 * {@link CardPayment.Factory} members are straight-line, so branch coverage is
 * complete once every member is exercised. The tests assert the applied amount
 * is forwarded to {@link TicketPayment}, that the default constructor leaves the
 * inherited fields at their declared defaults, that the factory key is "CARD",
 * that {@code create} ignores the tendered amount (no change on card), and that
 * the "CARD" discriminator resolves through {@link TicketPayment#getMethodKey()}.
 * No static finder or persist is reached, so no Panache mocking is required.
 * Each test is fully isolated and asserts absolute expected values.
