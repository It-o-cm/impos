/**
 * Unit tests for {@link TicketRestoPayment}, targeting 100% branch coverage.
 * <p>
 * The class carries no branching logic: both constructors and the CDI
 * {@link TicketRestoPayment.Factory} members are straight-line, so branch
 * coverage is complete once every member is exercised. The tests assert the
 * applied amount is forwarded to {@link TicketPayment}, that the default
 * constructor leaves the inherited fields at their declared defaults, that the
 * factory key is "TR", that {@code create} ignores the tendered amount (no
 * change on meal vouchers by store rule), and that the "TR" discriminator
 * resolves through {@link TicketPayment#getMethodKey()}. No static finder or
 * persist is reached, so no Panache mocking is required. Each test is fully
 * isolated and asserts absolute expected values.
